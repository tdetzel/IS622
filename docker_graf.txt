So you’ve done an awesome piece of data analysis. You proved within a hair’s width that climate change will flood the White House at least 19 times in the next 20 years. Awesome! But can anyone else replicate your work? Perhaps — but it’s conducted on your own machine with your software and your peculiar melange of supporting packages, versions unknown. Solution! Docker makes it easy for anyone to check your work — or advance it — because you’ve used a container that perfectly reproduces your environment and can be easily shared by all those naysayers who want to strike you down and return the world to sanity. Or advance science. That, my friend, is the price of transparency. To the creators of Docker — Bravo! Just use it!
